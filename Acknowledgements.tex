Doing a PhD is hard and it doesn't get any easier when the thing you're studying is always `just around the corner' from discovery.

Calculations indicate that there should be roughly one dark matter particle per pint in the Solar neighbourhood. During the course of this PhD, I've checked plenty of pints and I've yet to find evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model.
